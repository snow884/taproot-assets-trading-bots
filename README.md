# Trading bots for Taproot Assets

An example of what a trading bots maintaining the price of stable coins, random alt cons and synthetic assets would look like.

This repo uses [Tiramisu wallet API](https://testnet.tarowallet.net/walletapp/) and [Yahoo Finance data API](https://algotrading101.com/learn/yahoo-finance-api-guide/).

The bots are configured to trade on Bitcoin testnet for now.
